# Introduction

Here is my workflow to setup my all machines (Linux | Mac).

[Doc](https://captainvincent.github.io/env-setup-workflow/)

There are no easy way compatible cross platform and automated, but I try to keep these key points as below:

- Consistency
    - Use the same setup flow as more as possible
    - Keep common tools could be installed on all targets
- Use clear and individual manual guide and semi-automatic scripts to complete the workflow
- Integrate with these tools
    - mackup
    - chezmoi
    - homebrew | linuxbrew with homebrew-bundle
